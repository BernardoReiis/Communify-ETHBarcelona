<h1>Communify - ETH Barcelona Hackathon Project</h1>

<h2>How we built it</h2>

Tech stack: React, Typescript, Tailwind, EVM-compatible smart contracts written in Solidity provides business logic and trust for the platform, IPFS to store images of energy community membership NFTs, Chainlink Functions with Automation, Magic Link

<h2>Smart contract functionalities:</h2>

The smart contracts used in Communify provide the following: Create new Communities: Users can use the platform to create energy communities with a DAO governance. Energy Communities are defined in regulatory frameworks across Europe and USA to allow citizens, businesses and public entities to take an active role in decarbonization. One of the advantages is the possibility of exchanging energy between the members of the community in a P2P (peer-to-peer) scheme.

Financing: The Crowdloan smart contract allows investors to pledge assets to a particular community. During a certain period the funds are locked. Afterwards, the investors are able to withdraw their funds plus the yield.

Operation Support: The platform leverages zkSync to fetch the following: 

SDK connection to Endaoment

The data is stored on chain, c

<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>

We took up the challenge of aggregating the data from various sources and incorporating Chainlink Functions to build the most informative level of dashboard info for our users. Our solution works to bridge Web3 with Web2 and we found the process was very helpful using Chainlink. We will work on solving the local electric regulatory issues with further reach into the markets and we find that certain markets are more open to energy communities formation. We see our project development in creating a hybrid of a dApp and a educational resource to help bring the communities of stakeholders onboard with this streamlined way of growing energy communities.

<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>

We excited about finishing our dApp for the hackathon and building a well-coordinated team with clear vision for developing the project. We’ve managed to allow the creation of an energy community, bring on-board community members, generate a crowd lending campaign, and build a dashboard with data coming in from multiple sources using Chainlink. We were excited to get a strong understanding of the Chainlink Functions feature and look forward to continue to learn and improve as we build further.

<h2>What we learned</h2>

We learned that when re-thinking existing energy communities with a blockchain based governance it fundamentally changes the game and creates new opportunities and a better alignment with the best pricing for solar users. The Chainlink Functions feature opened up possibilities to integrate off-chain data that makes the market algorithm execution smooth and efficient. The whole process makes it easier to make decisions as an energy community and as stakeholders in the community.

<h2>What's next for Communify</h2>

With the right funding we aim to target the growing solar energy market and:

1. Further validate assumptions
1. Release and launch MVP on Testnet
1. Onboard our first industrial energy community
1. Increase the team
1. Expand platform features and capabilities

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
